       "2. **Religious**: Many religious traditions provide specific meanings of life based on the belief in a higher power or an ultimate purpose. For example, in Christianity, life may be seen as a journey to know and serve God, while in Buddhism, it may involve the pursuit of enlightenment and the alleviation of suffering.\n",
       "\n",

       "4. **Personal**: For many, the meaning of life is derived from personal fulfillment, relationships, and contributions to society. People often find purpose through love, creativity, work, and helping others.\n",
